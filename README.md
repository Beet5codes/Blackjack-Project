  This is a project is a simple blackjack game made for my arcitecture class. The program creates a deck of cards and shuffles it then dealing the cards out to the player and dealer but only showing one of the dealers cards in the beginning. The player either hits or stays and if they go over 21 or have a lower score then the dealer they lose. Most of my game works by having C call functions from assembly that do most of the work. Unfortunately I wasn't able to implement the shuffledDeck function in assembly because by the time I went back to try and fix it I had already relied upon the array I had defined in C that I wasn't able to get the function to work. 

  This simple game project was an acculmulation of multiple different concepts I had learned throughout the class. It really helped reinforce how calling conventions work between C and assembly since. It also relied heavily on macros which helped me understand how they work and how the address works with them better.  

  Here's an example of the output:
