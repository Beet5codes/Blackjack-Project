This is a project is a simple blackjack game made for my arcitecture class. The program creates a deck of cards and shuffles it then dealing the cards out to the player and dealer but only showing one of the dealers cards in the beginning. The player either hits or stays and if they go over 21 or have a lower score then the dealer they lose.
